				<strong>Get rid of ugly, visible equipment and their messy cables for good!<br><br></strong>Everyone wants&nbsp;a modern, clean look free of an ugly stack of components or devices showing on top of your cabinet or media credenza. The solution is to hide them away with a Remote Repeater System from Honest Install. <br><br>
				<strong>Eliminate Clutter:</strong>&nbsp;Now you can you hide your home entertainment equipment inside a closed-cabinet or relocate them&nbsp;to a closet and still be in total control of your devices and best of all ugly equipment never has to show. Remote Repeaters by Honest are compatible with any IR based remote so they'll work with your standard remote controls and 99% of devices.<br><br>
				<strong>How it works:</strong>&nbsp;A discrete, small sensor&nbsp;is placed near your TV and the other end (inside a cabinet or closet) features emitters that attach to each IR based component in order to "talk"&nbsp;to or communicate with your equipment when behind closed doors or located in another room/closet. A Remote Repeater, IR Kit, IR Repeater or IR Extender as they are often referred to as, all achieve the same goal in that they allow you to transmit the signal from an IR based remote to&nbsp;components hidden away. IR simply&nbsp;stands for "Infrared", the invisible light that most remote controls use to talk with a device or TV. <br><br><br>
				<small>*May not be compatible with all systems, if so alternatives such as RF based remotes are available. Conditions such as extreme sunlight or reflective TV surfaces or windows can cause the IR receiver to receive interference in which case an upgraded IR receiver may be recommended at an additional charge. Some installations may require a cable to be located between the TV and components at an additional charge. Call for details. </small>
