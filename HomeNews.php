      HDTV?</A><BR></EM></STRONG></FONT><BR>In a lifetime there comes an 
      innovation which brings huge benefits to the human species. The tele is 
      such a invention. Since the TV sets invention the human species have been 
      on the pursuit for better and better TV sets. Now alas HDTV TVs have 
      satisfied the urges of many film buffs. <BR><BR>HDTV TVs or 
      high-definition TV sets are an amazing new technological advancement to 
      the HD TV. Ever since coming to the consumer market HDTV TVs have created 
      a craze. Movie film lovers, sport fans, and anyone who wants the screen to 
      be as real as real life is amazed at what HDTV TVs show on their screens. 
      <BR><BR>We may enquire what is HD TV, particularly when we have not seen 
      one of these great HDTV TVs in the past? The HDTV basics is that you watch 
      TV at high-definition. A HD TV has extraordinary resolution and superb 
      digital surround sound. A HD TV removes the dreadful black bars that a lot 
      of movie formats come with. Putting it simply - a HD TV is watching wide 
      screen how it is meant to be! Since HDTV TVs have been released, they have 
      been in high demand. Anyone who wants the best out of a TV set wants to 
      get a HDTV and learn about HDTV. As with all untried technologies released 
      there is a lot to learn about all the new specifications and which HD TV 
      to buy. <BR><BR>When buying a HD TV for home, you want to make sure that 
      you are actually getting a HD TV. If you don't want to end up with a 
      television with ordinary visual and audio, then you need to recognize the 
      differences between analog and HDTV formats to determine if you really 
      need an upgrade for your watching enjoyment.&nbsp;<BR><BR><EM>-Features of 
      HDTV TVs</EM> <BR><BR>Technically, a HD TV give a much better and improved 
      screen resolution. Basically meaning that your HD TV, can easily provide 
      you with better picture quality whether you are watching a good DVD film 
      or a documentary it doesn't matter. You simply have amazing picture 
      quality (though the end result depends on your signal quality). The big 
      highlight of HDTV TVs is that you can watch wide screen as it is meant to 
      be, without having parts of the screen cropped. HDTVs simply give a 
      unprecedented picture quality that is crisper and finer than existing TV 
      sets. <BR><BR>A great thing with these new HDTV TVs is that they can 
      easily complement other analog based video equipment, such as your 
      camcorders, DVD players, gaming consoles. On a gaming console such as the 
      Sony Playstation range, you can see a new level of experience with a HD 
      TV. <BR><BR>Buying a HD TV can be the best buy you can make. The picture 
      quality is simply breathtaking, and will please many whether used for 
      playing video games on the console or watching a $100 million film, you 
      will be pleased with a HD TV. One thing to bear in mind with HDTV TVs is 
      that your HD TV may be great, and offer the best possible picture known to 
      man! But if your provider of the signal (TV company, etc) can't give a 
      good signal, it doesn't matter your picture quality will be no good. Also 
      when you buy a new HD TV to keep in mind to get a flexible HD TV, one that 
      has features which you may not use now, but might need in future - such as 
      DVI or HDMI. <BR><BR>Schedule an Honest Install Today!<FONT

      border=0 src="images/HI-Diamond.gif">&nbsp;<A name=2>Flat Panel TVs And 
      Monitors? The Dilemma Of Choice</A></STRONG></EM></P>
      <P align=left>Your thin flat panel TV can grace your room by hanging on 
      the wall like a piece of art, or it can sit on a trendy stand, catching 
      everyone’s eye when they enter the room, or just rest sedately on a table. 
      But the technologies that go into flat panel TVs, namely LCD and plasma 
      have their own pros and cons, depending on the application. Flat panel LCD 
      TVs and flat panel monitors for computers use the same technology? Liquid 
      Crystal Display (a.k.a LCD)? Which produces sharp and bright images in 
      most lighting types. <BR><BR>LCD technology? Popular Choice LCDs shine 
      light through pixel cells that have a red, green and blue component, but 
      they cannot turn off certain pixels. Hence, the ability of LCDs to produce 
      a pure black is less, which in turn has an effect on contrast levels. If 
      the LCD panel is more than 40 inches wide, they are obviously more 
      expensive than flat panel plasma TVs and rear projection TVs. But they are 
      affordable when you look for 15-21 inch-wide screens for smaller rooms. 
      Major manufacturers who make these are Sharp, Philips, Dell, Samsung, 
      Sony, etc. <BR><BR>The main advantages of liquid crystal display panels 
      are that they are lightweight, thin and do not consume much power. CRT or 
      conventional cathode ray tube monitors are being used lesser and lesser 
      because of the obvious advantages of flat panel LCDs over them. LCD 
      displays are mostly TFT panels or thin film transistor LCDs, an active 
      matrix. They have the property of high quality displays and smaller size, 
      which is what makes them popular for many uses. <BR><BR>Plasma Flat Panel 
      TVs The other flat panel option - Plasma TVs - look very elegant and 
      streamlined. You can choose the best from Sony, Pioneer, Samsung, Philips, 
      and Hitachi etc. whose wide screens can be anything from 36 inches to 
      about 70 inches. These are renowned for their color accuracy and can be 
      viewed from anywhere in the room. They pass an electric charge to cells 
      filled with gas, which in turn respond with a burst of ultraviolet light 
      to produce images; hence plasma TVs are said to be prone to the burn in 
      phenomenon. <BR><BR>Flat Panel TV LCD Or Plasma? Which Is Better? Flat 
      panel TVs have great advantages in terms of being thinner and lighter? 
      making them a better option in terms of flexibility in placement. The 
      digital display quality is precisely controlled producing an amazing array 
      of colors. They are immune to magnetic picture distortions, so you don't 
      have to worry about putting them close to speakers that are not shielded. 
      Flat panel TVs give you good image focus making straight lines look 
      straight. About the only downside is the fact that flat panel TVs are 
      costlier than conventional TVs. So thin is definitely in with both LCD and 
      Plasma TVs. Plasma TVs are invariably larger than LCDs and have a wider 
      viewing angle. In terms of brightness, LCD panels are better when lights 
      are bright. Plasma TVs produce blacker blacks. <BR><BR>This is the time 
      prices are getting more and more affordable, since prices for LCD and 
      Plasma TV are decreasing quite rapidly. <BR><BR>Schedule an Honest Install

      Introduction</A></STRONG></EM></FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT color=#808080>HDTV stands for High Definition 
      Television, and if you live in the USA, Australia, or Japan you may 
      already have experienced it. There are three key differences between HDTV 
      and what's become known as standard definition TV ie regular NTSC, PAL or 
      SECAM. The three differences are; an increase in picture resolution, 16:9 
      widescreen as standard, and the ability to support multi-channel audio 
      such as Dolby Digital.<BR><BR>The most important aspect of HDTV, and the 
      one which gives it its name is the increased resolution. Standard 
      definition NTSC broadcasts have 525 horizontal lines, and PAL broadcasts 
      are slightly better at 625 lines. In both these systems however, the 
      actual number of lines used to display the picture, known as the active 
      lines, is fewer than that. In addition, both PAL and NTSC systems are 
      interlaced, that is, each frame is spit into two fields, one field is the 
      odd-numbered lines and the other is the even lines. Each frame is 
      displayed alternately and our brain puts them together to create a 
      complete image of each frame. This has an adverse affect on picture 
      quality.<BR><BR>HDTV is broadcast in one of two formats; 720p and 1080i. 
      The numbers refer to the number of lines of vertical resolution and the 
      letters refer to whether the signal is progressive scan, 'p', or 
      interlaced, 'i'. Progressive scan means that each frame is shown in its 
      entirety, rather than being split into fields. Both systems are 
      significantly better quality than either PAL or NTSC broadcasts.<BR>HDTV 
      uses 16:9 widescreen as is its aspect ratio so widescreen pictures are 
      transmitted properly and not letterboxed or panned and scanned. Dolby 
      Digital multi-channel sound can be broadcast as part of an HDTV signal, so 
      if you have a surround sound speaker set-up you can use it to listen to TV 
      rather than just DVDs.<BR><BR>To receive an HDTV broadcast you need either 
      a TV with a built-in HDTV tuner or a HDTV receiver which can pick-up off 
      the air HDTV channels, or cable or satellite HDTV like. You also need to 
      live in areas where HDTV channels are broadcast or distributed by cable or 
      satellite.<BR><BR>Currently HDTV is widespread in Japan and is becoming 
      commonplace in the US, with most major networks distributing HDTV versions 
      of their popular content. The 2005 SuperBowl led to a large increase in 
      the demand for Fox Sports HDTV and cable companies scrambled to add it to 
      their offering in the run up to the game. In Australia, HDTV uptake was 
      sluggish initially but has increased significantly since 2003.<BR><BR>The 
      situation in Europe is not so bright. There is only one company 
      broadcasting HDTV in the whole of Europe, Euro1080, and it has only two 
      HDTV channels, both in the 1080i format. Euro1080HDe shows major cultural 
      and sporting events to cinemas and clubs around Europe, while HD1 
      broadcasts sports, opera, rock music, and lifestyle programs via satellite 
      to homes in Europe. UK satellite broadcaster, Sky, which is owned by Fox 
      proprietor Rupert Murdoch, has announced plans to broadcast some HDTV 
      content in 2006. The BBC has also made noises about broadcasting HDTV 
      programs (it already films some programs in HD format).<BR><BR>However, it 
      will be a while before HDTV in Europe catches up with the rest of the 
      world. The controversy created by the confirmation of plans by the UK 
      government to start switching off analogue transmitters in 2008 showed how 
      many people have yet to make the switch to DVB-T. That will be used as an 
      argument to show that there is no appetite in the UK for another major 
      change in TV broadcasting - particularly as most people think they already 
      have 'digital TV' in the form of DVB-T.<BR><BR>Given that television was 
      invented by a Briton, and Europe led the way with PAL for so long, this is 
      a rather sorry state of affairs.</FONT><BR><BR>Schedule an Honest Install

      the way you used to watch the television with the new TV on the block that 
      has made the conventional analog television sets run for their survival. 
      We are talking about a plasma HDTV. It's a new technology that has 
      altogether changed the whole scenario. The High Definition Plasma 
      Television is here, that is what popularly known as Plasma HDTV, that has 
      given a new dimension to the TV watching experience. But, is the 
      technology worth of receiving so much of praise. In this case you have to 
      see it to believe it. As the name itself reflects, the HDTV is a high 
      definition TV that changes the picture quality by bringing more life to it 
      and thus has many advantages over the conventional analog TV set. 
      <BR><BR>Let's talk about what you get when you go in for the Plasma HDTV. 
      <BR><BR>Much Higher resolution: this is where the Plasma HDTV can beat any 
      competition coming its way. Compared to the conventional TV sets, the 
      Plasma display devices have much higher resolution, and are capable of 
      displaying full HDTV and DTV signals as well as XGA, SVGA and VGA signals 
      from a computer. <BR><BR>Elimination of scan lines: Contrary to the Plasma 
      TV the conventional TV monitors use an electron beam to scan the picture 
      tube at regular intervals that may produce the scan lines, in a standard 
      NTSC TV. Plasma displays in this case, include built-in line doubling to 
      improve image quality when switched to standard analog video sources such 
      as TV broadcasts and VCR tapes. <BR><BR>Exceptional color accuracy: 
      Another great advantage is the exceptional color accuracy that is achieved 
      through displaying 16.77 million colors that can bring any picture to 
      life. <BR><BR>Wide-screen aspect ratio: To bring back the experience of 
      watching films in theatre, Plasma display devices have a wide-screen 16:9 
      aspect ratio, that allows the DVD-Video movies to be viewed in wide-screen 
      format. Perfect flat screen: is another biggest advantage with Plasma 
      screens. This helps to eliminate the edge distortion that can occur in 
      normal displays. <BR><BR>Uniform screen brightness: the realism can be 
      achieved with this factor that also helps in soothing the eyes with the 
      plasma displays illuminating every pixels evenly across the screen. 
      <BR><BR>Slim space-saving design: a few inches thin, hag it on any wall 
      you like and it gives you the installation options as never before. Don’t 
      bother about the standalone way if you don’t want to keep it like that. 
      The best part is the can match your decor, and actually increase the style 
      statement of your home. Wide viewing angles: of 160 degrees allows a 
      larger number of viewers to enjoy perfect image reproduction irrespective 
      of their position in the room. <BR><BR>Universal display capability: makes 
      them include and play a wide video formats. Most of the plasma HDTV ware 
      compatible with composite video (NTSC, PAL SECAM) (standard RCA jacks), 
      S-video and component video inputs, plus one or more RGB inputs to accept 
      the video output from a computer. <BR><BR>Resistance to magnetic fields: 
      as they do not use the electron beams like the conventional TV sets, they 
      are unfazed by the effects of magnetic fields. That is why it can be 
      placed in a close proximity to any device that produces magnetic fields, 
      for instance, speakers. <BR><BR><BR>Schedule an Honest Install Today!<FONT

      color=#808080>Just because you are looking for a home theater does not 
      mean you have to spend a small fortune to get it. A home theater can still 
      work for those of us on tight budgets that still want to make the most of 
      our viewing pleasure. With more people being interested in television on a 
      regular basis, a great home theater setup is a must in many homes. 
      <BR><BR>Home theater surrounds can vary from home to home. In many parts 
      of the country, the homes have the ever popular basement. If you remember 
      back to when you were a kid, the basement was used for storing things like 
      the Christmas tree and that old couch that no one has sat on in ten years. 
      Make sure that the basement is suitable for a living area such as a home 
      theater with its many electronic devices. If your basement tends to hold 
      water in heavy rains, you may reconsider placing your 52" plasma screen 
      television in those conditions. The basement can actually be one of the 
      best places for a home theater. By placing the theater in the basement, 
      you are able to utilize two or more walls that are already soundproofed 
      because they are typically concrete walls with an earthen barrier on the 
      opposite side. The only need for soundproofing will be in the ceiling and 
      the fourth wall. By being able to skimp by only having to soundproof those 
      two areas, you may be able splurge on a better home theater system. 
      <BR><BR>Setting up your home theater to resemble the real theater can add 
      to the experience of having a home theater. Start by adding the correct 
      lighting to the room. Don't have big bulky overhead lighting, concentrate 
      on rope lighting in the floors along with tiered seating and comfortable 
      chairs for relaxing. Make sure that the seats that you choose are equipped 
      with cup holders, or that there is a convenient place nearby each seat for 
      each family member to place their popcorn and soda. Use dark, sound 
      proofing drapes on the walls for sound absorption as well as appearance. 
      All of these suggestions for decor can really cost a ton of money. But you 
      should be frugal when shopping for decor, after all, you want to spend the 
      bulk of your money on the viewing and listening details of the theater, 
      right? Here are some suggestions for decorating your home theater on a 
      budget. <BR><BR>Flea markets are a great source for bargains. You may be 
      able to find old movie posters, popcorn machines, fabrics for the walls, 
      etc. Most towns have a regular flea market, but if you are willing to take 
      some time for travel to other nearby towns, you will likely be able to 
      find more options for your decor. <BR><BR>The internet has everything. 
      Auction sites such as <A href="http://www.ebay.com">www.ebay.com</A> sell 
      everything you could ever need or want for your home theater. If you know 
      what you are looking for, type it into a search engine and just sit back 
      and look at all the results you find. Bargain sites and auction sites 
      usually offer the best prices on these types of items, but check around 
      before committing to anything. <BR><BR>Your local classified section is 
      always a good place to start. Most towns and cities have classified 
      sections of their newspaper where people are trying to get rid their old 
      items or items that they just no longer need. You can usually find a great 
      deal on many items by searching the classified section. <BR><BR>Shopping 
      at outlet stores can be a great way to find bargains. The problem with 
      shopping at the outlets is that many people binge shop at these type 
      places and usually don't come home with what they went for. <BR><BR>In 
      short, when you actually go to set up your home theater system, check the 
      prices on items and try to be frugal. Home theaters do not have to be 
      expensive as long as you understand how to set them up 
      correctly.<BR><BR><BR>Schedule an Honest Install Today!<FONT

      color=#808080>It's hard to deny the fact that plasma TVs offer the best 
      quality picture ever since the tube is introduced to mankind!! The 
      crystal-clear quality of Plasma TVs makes it popular with consumers even 
      when the price was really quite ludicrous. But now, with the skyrocketing 
      demand for Plasma TVs, Plasma TVs has become more affordable. Encouraged 
      by the receptiveness of consumers, TV manufacturers relies on amazing 
      technology to come up with super-thin Plasma TV designs that can be 
      mounted right on the wall! This will definitely satisfy the need of ANY 
      couch potato. <BR><BR>As a consumer, you probably are not too interested 
      in the in-depth information about how Plasma TVs are created, designed and 
      manufactured. But we think you might want to know a little bit more about 
      the technology of how manufacturers manage to make Plasma TV so thin and 
      crystal clear. True enough, the picture on the Plasma TV is probably only 
      thing that matters to the kids when they watch their favorite program on 
      the brand new Plasma TV in the living room, but don't you feel a tad 
      curious about how come Plasma TVs can be so slender and yet provide such 
      amazingly stunning visuals? <BR><BR>Within the thin casing of the Plasma 
      TV, there are hundreds of thousands of tiny plasma-filled chambers. 
      Depending on the quality of the Plasma TV, the number of plasma-filled 
      chambers depends on the quality (and pricing of the Plasma TV). The higher 
      the number of plasma-filled chambers there are, the better the quality, 
      the higher the price. Makes sense? <BR><BR>And when you switch the Plasma 
      TV on, electricity runs through and lights up the Plasma-filled chambers 
      in the TV and the result is the picture that you see on your TV screen. 
      <BR><BR>We all know that Plasma TVs give the most realistic pictures 
      compared to the conventional TV. The picture from a Plasma TV is more 
      focused. Plasma TV manufacturers and designers design Plasma TVs in such a 
      way that it is so thin that you can literally place it anywhere! They are 
      sometimes no more than 4" thick. And because Plasma TVs can display up to 
      68 BILLION colors, you can get nothing less than a realistic picture on 
      the screen!! On top of that, some Plasma TVs can be mounted on the wall 
      saving you space in your living room. <BR><BR><BR>Schedule an Honest

      TV</A></EM></STRONG></P>
      <P align=left>When purchasing a flat panel TV, there are a few things to 
      keep in mind. Here, we've listed a number of considerations for you to 
      evaluate.<BR><BR><EM>-High Definition Upgradeable or 
      HDTV-Ready</EM><BR><BR>If you see either of these terms used when deciding 
      to purchase a flat screen TV, it means that the TV is capable of producing 
      the highest resolutions possible for digital television today. 
      "Upgradeable" means that you'll need to first add a separate HDTV receiver 
      before you can view the pictures in high definition mode (1080i or 720p). 
      But, even if you don't upgrade, the picture will still look fantastic. 
      When watching regular DVDs or TV broadcasts, the picture will be almost as 
      good as real HDTV because most have line-doublers to improve the 
      picture.<BR><BR><EM>-16:9 Aspect Ratio</EM><BR><BR>Unlike conventional 
      televisions, new plasma, LCD and rear-projection televisions most likely 
      have a wide, rectangular screen that is very similar to the shape of a 
      movie screen. This is known as 16:9 aspect ratio—for every 16 inches wide, 
      the screen is 9 inches high. Compared to conventional TVs, which are 4:3 
      in aspect ratio, the field of vision is wider for a new flat screen 
      TV.<BR><BR>When watching DVDs at home on a 16:9 wide-screen television, 
      you will be able to enjoy the full screen effect of the movie the way it 
      was intended. On the other hand, when watching regular, standard 
      definition television (like a news broadcast or talk show), you will need 
      to either set the television to fill the screen entirely or watch with 
      vertical black bars on either side of the picture.<BR><BR>Finally, 
      remember that even though most television broadcasts are in 4:3 format, 
      16:9 widescreen format is the way of the future. Many events are shot in 
      HDTV format (for example, the Olympics, special sporting events, nature 
      documentaries, etc.) and as more and more people purchase high definition 
      television, all broadcasts will be in high definition within the next few 
      years.<BR><BR><EM>-Reverse 3:2 PullDown</EM><BR><BR>Television shows are 
      usually shot on film at 24 frames per second. When transferred to video 
      running at 30 frames per second, the picture quality is distorted in the 
      translation. New televisions are able to correct those distortions through 
      a series of re-conversion techniques which reverse the distortions. The 
      result is a smoother and cleaner picture.<BR><BR>When looking to buy a new 
      plasma, LCD or rear-projection television, look for this 
      feature.<BR><BR><EM>-3-D Y/C Digital Comb Filter</EM><BR><BR>The 3D Y/C 
      digital comb filter's job is to take the cable signal coming from the wall 
      and separate the color, sound, brightness information into useable 
      information. New plasma, LCD and rear-projection televisions have digital 
      3D Y/C comb filters that do a pretty good job of this so as to avoid what 
      is know as "dot crawl" where the edges of objects appear rough. In 
      addition, a good digital comb filter will also counter the effects of 
      moiré, where still objects appear to move and ripple.<BR>Most high end 
      plasma, LCD and rear-projection televisions also have component inputs 
      from video sources (such as a DVD player) that separate the signal before 
      reaching the TV and bypass the digital comb filter. This results in an 
      even clearer and brighter 
      picture.<BR><BR><EM>-Picture-in-Picture</EM><BR><BR>Picture-in-Picture (or 
      PIP) allows you to watch two shows at once, with the second show in a box 
      in a part of the screen. PIP is fairly common these days to all sorts of 
      televisions. However, consider getting a dual tuner PIP plasma, LCD or 
      projection television since that allows you to watch the second channel 
      without needing an external tuner (for example, from a VCR). In addition, 
      there are also TVs that will show different channels side by side—these 
      are called twin view PIP TVs.<BR><BR><EM>-Inputs</EM><BR><BR>"Inputs" 
      refer to how related audio/visual components connect to your plasma, LCD 
      or rear-projection television. The highest video quality input is known as 
      "component video". With component video inputs, the color and brightness 
      information from the cable is separated into useable data before entering 
      the television. The next best input is S-video input which give a picture 
      almost as good as component video—whereas component video separates 
      brightness, blue signal and red signal from each other, S-video just 
      separates brightness from blue and red signals.<BR><BR>All new plasma, LCD 
      and rear-projection televisions will also have inputs for various 
      multimedia devices such as DVD players. In addition, some will allow you 
      to connect a computer.<BR><BR><BR>Schedule an Honest Install Today!<FONT

      yourself when you can do it for free? <BR><BR>After you've ordered your 
      new satellite TV system your next step is to install it. Here you have the 
      option of installing your satellite TV system yourself, or letting a 
      professional do it for you. Here's what's involved ... 
      <BR><BR><EM>-Do-It-Yourself Satellite TV Installation</EM> <BR><BR>Here's 
      a step-by-step guide to satellite TV installation: <BR><BR>1.) First, you 
      need to mount your satellite dish on your roof or on a south-facing wall. 
      Pick a location where there are no trees or tall buildings nearby. 
      <BR><BR>2.) If you live in a condo or an apartment complex where you 
      aren't allowed to mount your dish outside, you can mount it inside or on 
      your balcony using a portable stand which can be ordered from your 
      satellite TV dealer. <BR><BR>3.) After installing your dish, you need to 
      connect your cable to your dish then feed the cable through your house 
      walls to the rooms where you have your TVs. <BR><BR>4.) Next, connect your 
      TVs to your satellite TV receivers, connect the cables from your dish to 
      your receivers, then connect your receivers to the nearest telephone jacks 
      with telephone wire. <BR><BR>5.) Now turn on your TV and your receiver and 
      have someone monitor the satellite TV provider's signal strength menu on 
      your TV while you use a compass to aim your dish by setting the correct 
      azimuth (direction). Then move your dish up, down, and sideways to obtain 
      the correct elevation (angle), and skew (dish rotation). <BR><BR>6.) 
      Finally, you'll need to contact your satellite TV provider to activate 
      your system. <BR>Note: If you're going to do your own satellite TV 
      installation, I recommend purchasing a satellite TV installation kit from 
      your dealer that comes with an installation guide and all the necessary 
      hardware. <BR><BR><EM>-Professional Satellite TV Installation</EM> 
      <BR><BR>Installation fees vary from dealer to dealer and can cost $100 to 
      $200 dollars or more, depending on how many receivers you want installed 
      and how complicated it will be to run the cable through your house walls. 
      <BR><BR>The good news is the two major satellite TV providers -- DISH 
      Network and DIRECTV -- are currently promoting their services by offering 
      a free satellite TV system that includes free installation. The only catch 
      is you must sign up for their service, but with prices starting at around 
      twenty dollars&nbsp;a month for service, that's a bargain. <BR><BR>After 
      you order your satellite TV service, your dealer will call you to schedule 
      an installation time that's convenient for you. This will be anywhere from 
      one to five days after you place your order. <BR><BR>After your installer 
      installs your system, he or she will show you how to operate it and will 
      answer any questions you may have. <BR><BR><EM>-Bottom Line</EM> 
      <BR><BR>Unless you're handy with tools and enjoy tinkering with 
      electronics, I recommend having a professional do your satellite TV 
      installation for you. With the free satellite TV system and free 
      installation package from DISH Network and DIRECTV, it's a deal that's 
      hard to beat.&nbsp;<BR></FONT><BR>Schedule an Honest Install Today!<FONT

      Theater projector screens come in a multitude of surface finishes. The 
      variety of surface finish you will need depends upon your projector model. 
      Screen surfaces vary from matte white, slightly silver or grey-ish, to 
      reflective glass beaded models. Glass beaded models increase the effective 
      brightness of your projector's image similar to the way a highway sign 
      reflects car headlights. Lower lumen-level (lumens=light output) 
      projectors such as CRT models benefit most from higher reflectivity (or 
      gain) of a screen's surface. Higher gain surfaces increase the perceived 
      brightness of the projected image. Conversely - a brighter projector looks 
      best with a matte white or even a silver/gray surface. That is because the 
      glass beads on higher gain screens have a tendency to "splatter" the 
      brighter light waves produced by a high lumen output projector. A 
      silver/gray surface will also enhance the perceived contrast level of LCD 
      projectors which do not have the best contrast/black levels. So first you 
      must decide the type and lumen output of the projector you are purchasing 
      and that will help determine the surface type of the video projector 
      screen you will need. <BR><BR><EM>-Model Types</EM> <BR><BR>Projection 
      screens come in three basic styles - manual pull-down, electric and fixed 
      varieties. Manual pull-down models are operated much like a window shade. 
      Electric models have a motorized mechanism that does the work for you and 
      fixed screens are motionless and stay right where you place them. Fixed 
      screens also provide the flattest of all screen surfaces. Pull-down and 
      electric screens can be susceptible to a slight waves on their surface. 
      Although not obtrusive if properly cared for, some may prefer the absolute 
      flat surface of a fixed screen model. The drawback to fixed screens is 
      that you must live with them in place whereas retractable models can be 
      deployed for viewing and afterwards be hidden from sight until next use. 
      <BR><BR><EM>-Aspect Ratio</EM> <BR><BR>There is another very important 
      factor to consider when shopping for a screen - that of the screen's 
      aspect ratio. The aspect ratio of a projection screen refers to the shape 
      of the available screen surface. Screens come in two basic aspect ratios 
      --? 4x3 which is your normal television aspect ratio and 16x9 which is the 
      normal widescreen or HDTV aspect ratio. The aspect ratio of your screen is 
      an important decision to make prior to its purchase. That's because of the 
      fact that once you buy it there's no way to change the aspect ratio - 
      other than by masking portions of the screen. You can mask the surface 
      with material or curtains if you want to get creative and that can 
      temporarily change the aspect ratio of your fixed screen. <BR><BR>You 
      will, of course, save a lot of time and trouble by thoroughly researching 
      your screen choice prior to its purchase. Whatever your application and 
      needs --- rest assured there is a projection screen surface and model 
      available to fit your particular situation. For further and more detailed 
      information on video projector screen applications for home theaters

      Speakers</A></EM></STRONG></FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT color=#808080>You have your television and home 
      theater receiver; you just bought your new speakers and subwoofer and are 
      ready to test things out. It's time to break out the measuring tape 
      because precision is vital to achieving the full potential of your home 
      theater system. For this article, we are going to focus on a 5.1 surround 
      sound system. The term "5.1" refers to the number of speakers and 
      subwoofers in the system respectively. So for a 5.1 surround sound system, 
      there are five speakers (the center channel, the two front speakers, and 
      the two rear speakers) and one subwoofer.<BR><BR>When placing your home 
      theater speakers, try to use the same amount of speaker wire for each type 
      of speaker. For example, use the same length of wire for each of the front 
      speakers. This will allow the signal to reach each speaker in about the 
      same instant. I say "about" because there are variations in the wire which 
      could cause the signal to reach one speaker slightly (fractions of a 
      fraction of a second) before the other. By making the two lengths equal, 
      you ensure that this delay remains tiny and 
      unnoticeable.<BR><BR><EM>-Center Channel</EM><BR><BR>The center channel 
      should always be placed either immediately above or immediately below the 
      viewing screen. Make sure the speaker is pointed directly at the 
      audience.<BR><BR><EM>-Front Speakers<BR></EM><BR>The two front speakers 
      should be the same distance from the audience as the center channel. Doing 
      this will ensure that the sound will travel from each speaker to the 
      audience in the same amount of time and reduce the chances of there being 
      a noticeable delay between what takes place on screen to when you hear it. 
      Each of the front speakers should also be positioned an equal distance 
      from the TV on either side. This distance is dependant on your specific 
      tastes; just make sure that the distances are both equal.<BR><BR><EM>-Rear 
      Speakers</EM><BR><BR>The rear speakers should be mounted on the walls on 
      either side of the audience. Their purpose is to provide a sense of 
      atmosphere, not provide the main sound for your home theater system. 
      Therefore, they should not be pointed directly at the audience's ears or 
      you risk over powering the center channel and the two front speakers. 
      Again, distance is important. Try to have the rear speakers the same 
      distance from the TV in order to use the same amount of speaker wire and 
      if possible have them placed equidistance from the 
      audience.<BR><BR><EM>-Subwoofer</EM><BR><BR>Bass tones by their nature are 
      more difficult to localize than the midrange and high notes of the other 
      five speakers. This will give you more freedom as to where to place the 
      subwoofer. However, the location surrounding the subwoofer can greatly 
      influence the bass tones you hear. Placing the subwoofer in a corner or 
      under a table will create a deeper resonating tone as the sound waves 
      reflect off of the surfaces. The placement of the subwoofer is up to you, 
      depending on the type of bass you want. Experiment with different 
      locations and find the one that best suits your taste.<BR><BR>Realizing 
      the full potential of your home theater speakers is not a difficult task. 
      By following these guidelines, you will be ready to enjoy your home 
      theater the way it was meant to be heard.<BR><BR>Schedule an Honest

      Video Display for Your Home Theater</A></EM></STRONG></FONT></FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT color=#808080><FONT color=#808080>First of all, don't 
      assume you need a huge video screen in your media room. If your screen is 
      too large, visual fatigue will detract from your theater experience. A 
      good, but general rule for screen size is to select a screen width that is 
      half to one third the distance from the screen to the primary viewing 
      location. You should keep the viewing cone, formed by a line going from 
      your eyes to each side of the screen, to about thirty degrees.<BR><BR>You 
      can use any display device and there advantages and disadvantages to each 
      type. DLP units tend to have better black levels than LCD units. LCOS 
      units and variations have the tightest pixel structure.<BR><BR><EM>-Front 
      Projection (often called DLP)</EM>&nbsp;<BR><BR>Advantages:<BR><BR>A front 
      projection set will produce the largest, most dynamic image. With a good 
      projector and screen combination the image will be quite stunning, 
      especially when watching native HDTV content. If you have never seen the 
      picture produced by a good, front projection set up, you really should see 
      one before you make any decisions.<BR><BR>Disadvantages:<BR><BR>Needs 
      ambient light control. You need to control ambient light to get a really 
      good picture because a front projection system cannot produce black. It 
      must rely on the absence of light being reflected from the screen to show 
      black or dark colors.<BR>You have to have a physical projector mounted 
      somewhere. This problem has improved tremendously in the last few years as 
      CRT projectors have basically gone away and digital projectors have 
      improved and shrunk to miniscule proportions.<BR><BR>Video projectors are 
      noisy. They require cooling fans and these are loud. Some recent units 
      however, are much quieter.<BR><BR>The larger picture and better detail 
      reproduction will allow you to really see problems so you need to have 
      quality video sources or the picture will suffer.<BR><BR>Many of the 
      projectors on the market are either business presentation units or adapted 
      from them. Business presentation projectors have much different 
      requirements than home theater projectors. The most important requirement 
      for business units is brightness. They sacrifice other performance 
      parameters to achieve this. Home theater projectors need extremely 
      accurate color rendition, accurate grey scale tracking, deep blacks, and 
      freedom from motion 
      artifacts.<BR><BR><EM>-Plasma</EM><BR><BR>Advantages:<BR><BR>They're thin! 
      Only 3 to 4 inches thick. They look great when displaying HDTV. (most of 
      them)<BR><BR>Disadvantages:<BR><BR>They can suffer image burn-in when 
      displaying static images. Many retailers and manufactures downplay the 
      dangers, but the phenomenon occurs with many different units. Do not leave 
      the cable or DSS menu screen up for an hour or two. Be careful when 
      displaying HTPC or computer game video with static images.<BR><BR>Many of 
      them look really bad when displaying non HD TV. This problem has lessened 
      with improved internal video processing and scaling technology. Some 
      plasmas actually look pretty good with a better quality DVD 
      feed.<BR><BR>Many plasmas suffer from rather severe image artifacts 
      although this is also improving greatly due to the better internal 
      processing.<BR><BR>Some plasma displays have high power consumption. (Can 
      be three times that of a standard tube TV)<BR><BR><EM>-LCD Flat Panel 
      (Liquid Crystal Display)</EM><BR><BR>Advantages:<BR><BR>They're thin! Some 
      are only three inches thick. They have no image burn problems like plasmas 
      do. Good picture on most newer sets. Long life (50,000 – 60,000 hours). 
      You can get a true, 1080P native resolution 
      display.<BR><BR>Disadvantages:<BR><BR>Sizes over 30 inches are priced 
      above equivalent sized plasma displays. The older units don't have picture 
      quality as good as plasma displays. Black and dark reproduction is not as 
      good as plasma yet. <BR><BR>Rear Projection TV can be either digital or 
      CRT based. The CRT units are going away fast as consumers move to thinner, 
      lighter digital rear projection TVs. At this point, the better CRT rear 
      projection sets offer fantastic performance for the money. You can get a 
      50+" HDTV ready CRT set from good companies such as Panasonic and Sony for 
      under $1,500. These bargains will be gone soon as production of CRT rear 
      projection sets stops. Panasonic has indicated the 2005 model year will be 
      their last for CRT RPTVs.<BR><BR>The disadvantage to CRT rear projection 
      TVs is size and weight. They too will suffer image burn problems if left 
      with a static image for too long. They require accurate convergence to 
      look their best. Most newer units offer multi-point convergence 
      adjustments to facilitate this.<BR><BR>There are some new types of flat 
      panel displays that will be released for consumer use soon including 
      Organic Light Emitting Diode (OLED) and SED. These promise even better 
      image quality than either LCD or plasma when fully developed, in addition 
      to lower cost, thinner profiles and much lower power 
      consumption.<BR><BR>In a nutshell:<BR><BR>Front Projection – Large image, 
      can have spectacular picture quality even on a huge screen – More 
      difficult to set up, need to place the projector in the center of the room 
      somewhere, noisy(some), must use better quality sources to get the most 
      benefit.<BR><BR>Plasma – Cool factor, thin, look good for HDTV – Image 
      burn problems, can sometimes have a mediocre picture for all but HDTV 
      sources<BR><BR>LCD – Cool factor, thin, look good for HDTV, no Image burn 
      problems, - Expensive for larger sizes, can sometimes have a mediocre 
      picture for all but HDTV sources.<BR><BR>There are many display 
      technologies available today. No one display is best for all situations.

      now-a-days:</EM><BR></FONT><BR><FONT size=3><FONT color=#f4b800>ANALOG VS. 
      DIGITAL</FONT> <BR></FONT></STRONG><BR>Traditional analog TV has an aspect 
      ratio of 4:3 (almost square). This means that a TV screen is 4 inches wide 
      for every 3 inches it is tall. The reason for this is because when 
      broadcasting was created it was made for video-based cameras to broadcast 
      TV programs, news and not so much movies. This was before the time of 
      VCR’s, DVD Players, Pay TV (Such as Cable &amp; Satellite) and readily 
      available video rentals/sales.<BR><BR>Most digital televisions have an 
      aspect ratio of 16:9 (rectangular) and are called “widescreen.”&nbsp; This 
      is in part to accommodate content produced by film cameras such as motion 
      pictures (movies).<BR><BR>When the aspect ratio of the television program 
      and your television set do not match, bars on the top and/or sides of the 
      image may appear to ensure that the image is not distorted. In order to 
      properly display 16:9 content on a 4:3 set, your digital television or 
      digital-to-analog converter box may place bars at the top and bottom of 
      the image – a process called “letterboxing.”<BR><BR></P>

      <P><BR>&nbsp;Similarly, to properly display 4:3 content on a 16:9 
      television set, bars may be placed on the sides of the screen – a process 
      called <BR>“pillar boxing”, seen on the left image.&nbsp;</P>
      <P>Most modern televisions have a feature to change the aspect ratio. It 
      is usually labeled “ratio”, “aspect”, or “format” on your TV remote. This 
      will allow you to compensate for formatting problems associated with 
      differences in aspect ratios.</P>

      <P><A

      table was provided by Oceanic Time Warner Cable.</A></P>
      <P>The resolution of a TV is usually written out as "horizontal resolution 
      x vertical resolution." For example, a TV may have a resolution of 1386 x 
      788 pixels - 1386 pixels in the horizontal direction and 788 
      vertically.<BR><BR>As with the lines of resolution, you most commonly 
      refer to the vertical number of pixels and use that number when deciding 
      if you can really call a TV an HDTV. A TV must have at least 720 vertical 
      pixels to be called HDTV-capable. In the table above the Maximum 
      resolution refers to the vertical resolution (pixels). The “i” and “p” 
      next to the resolution will be explained in the next 
      section.<BR><BR><BR><STRONG><FONT color=#f4b800 size=3>PROGRESSIVE VS. 
      INTERLACED (i.e. 1080i vs. 1080p)</FONT></STRONG> <BR><BR>&nbsp;It’s time 
      to grab the duct tape. If your brain hasn’t already been overloaded, this 
      may put you over the edge. All analog programs are interlaced video but, 
      high definition video can be either interlaced “i” or progressively “p” 
      scanned. It's important to understand these terms.<BR><BR>Interlaced video 
      is scanned from side to side, top to bottom. Every 60th of a second, every 
      other line making up the complete picture is scanned. Then, a 60th of a 
      second later, the lines in-between the lines that have already appeared 
      are scanned. </P>
      <P>Effectively, half the picture's vertical resolution is sent in the 
      first 60th of a second, and the second half is sent in the second 60th of 
      a second. Both of these "halves" are displayed 30 times per second, which 
      makes 1 solid picture to the human eye. </P>
      <P>Progressive scan video is scanned from side to side, top to bottom: 
      line 1, line 2, line 3 etc.&nbsp; The full picture is displayed 60 times 
      per second, twice as many times as interlaced video.&nbsp; Progressively 
      scanning the video also helps reduce a flickering effect that you might 
      see out of interlaced video. <BR><BR>To sum this section up progressively 
      scanning video provides twice the picture as does an interlaced video with 
      the same number of lines of resolution. </P>
