					<font size="2"><em>A review from Junior Achievement – Educating youth to be the future entrepreneurs of America: </em></font>
				</p>
				<p>
					<font size="2">We heard about Honest Install on Angie's list. I read several of the reports they had online and everyone was a glowing review, with all A+ ratings. So I called to get an estimate. My experience with the consultation and quoting process was great. The sales consultant came to our center and walked through asking all the right questions and provided a prompt estimate. He listened to me and gave us exactly what we needed.<br><br>
					We chose Honest Install over others, even though we received a total of three quotes, one of the companies did not even want to come out they just gave us a quote based on a phone conversation. Since we are a non-profit organization, we are always looking at cost, so we couldn't refuse Honest Install's offer. <br><br>
					We are very happy with the roof mounted antenna and TV installation. It looks great. I didn't have any worries that things wouldn't work. They were very professional. The time it took and the professionalism of the guys made me feel very well taken care of.</font>

					<font size="2"><em>Honest Install was selected to deploy the state-of-the-art interactive, touch-screen concierge system:</em></font>
				</p>
				<p>
					<font size="2">More than just digital signage, these interactive devices have been installed by Honest into dozens of major hotels and public locations located throughout the Dallas/Fort Worth Metroplex.<br><br>
					Similar to a giant smart-phone the 'TouchCierge' allows guests, patrons and visitors to access valuable localized directory information from restaurants/entertainment, flight schedules and even real-time news, local events and traffic conditions. </font>
				</p>
				<p>
					<font size="2">Fitted with the mounting bracket and custom wood grain frame these 47" industrial-grade, flat panel monitors feature integrated cameras and onboard pC's rounding out the overall weight&nbsp;to over 155lbs! </font>
				</p>
				<p>
					<font size="2">Honest pioneered the methodology and techniques for wall mounting these oversized units; experienced knowledge in residential and commercial building construction coupled with the use of special wall fasteners has allowed Honest to not only safely mount the TouchCierge systems but we also eliminated unsightly 'backer boards' or plywood reinforcements that are commonly used by installers for commercial applications.</font><br><br>
					<font size="2">Whether a simple&nbsp;upgrade for your home or for large corporate rollouts trust Honest Install.<br><br></font>
