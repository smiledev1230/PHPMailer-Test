I would have preferred an in person quote from Bob to really assess my needs rather than guessing and felt the sales portion fell flat again here. Fares and Chris did a great job on the install. It looks and operates great. I would definitely recommend and would use again. If you are doing anything on magnitude, ask them to come out in person beforehand.

I called around to get quotes from most of the install companies and this was by far the best.  After talking to them on the phone and reading other reviews on here, I felt confident in my choice.  They sent two guys out to the job (running a 50 ft HDMI line from the back of the room to the front, via a hard to access area in the attic for a projector in my media room) and was done in about an hour.  On top of that, they also pulled the pre-wired cable for my surrounds while they were there, saving me even more time and effort.  They also saved me future headaches with a projector mount that was much better than the one I was planning to use and installed theirs while there, all in the hour time frame!  
I usually don't write reviews, only for the above-and-beyond or the utterly awful...but these guys were awesome.  A few months after they came out, the connector for the HDMI cable that was installed (heavy duty, 50 ft) broke.  I called them to see if there was anything they could do and they sent another two guys back out and replaced it with a brand new cable AND put a 3 ft extender piece on it to prevent this from happening again!
I can't speak to how much they would charge for a bigger project, but for this job and what the other companies were going to charge--I couldn't have asked for anything better!  Thank you!!";

We recently purchased a house with a media room but I didn\'t get a good vibe when visiting Starpower, nor did trust myself enough to try and figure it all out on my own so I called Honest Install after seeing their high ratings on yelp.

John came out and took a look at what was already in the room, wiring in the attic, etc. and then we talked over what we wanted for a final setup.  He sent a detailed quote a couple days later; we discussed a few options via email over the next week or so before deciding to schedule the install.

The install team came out a few days later and got to work -- while making sure each step of the way that they were setting things up exactly how I wanted.  There were a few things that were not exactly as expected (some wiring was different than they had planned) but they had all the supplies needed to run different wiring and not hold up the process.  When everything was installed, the installer made sure he answered any questions I might have, saying he\'d stay as long as he needed.  I didn\'t have more than a couple questions but I thought it was nice he was willing to go over any concerns I may have had.

I\'m not sure I\'ll have another job like this since the media room is complete but if I do, I\'d definitely call them again.';

They measured 3 times in some instances to make sure the final product would both look and function exceptionally.  They even patched a hole I had from a prior nail I had that was just over where they hung the TV.  They did a great job of cleaning up, leaving my home in the same shape as they found it.  I think they actually left it better, since my TV and new sound system has my wife and I feeling like we are in a movie theater.

It ended up taking 3 hours which increased the price. The owner called me the next day and said that he was taking off the 3rd hour. That is fantastic customer service.';

So needless to say I had a lot of questions. <BR><BR>I first called Honest and was greeted by a very nice gentleman, he took the time to answer my questions on not one, but two phone calls. <BR><BR>We traded e-mails back and forth a few times and finally decided to go ahead cause their pricing was a bit less than some others we were considering and they sounded like they do this a lot. <BR><BR>They came out to wall mount our TV and install a surround sound system and from the looks of it it was not easy or something we could of done ourselves even in a weeks time!, Both guys took care of our home and cleaned up any mess before leaving were always polite answering yes ma'am, yes sir always. They walked us through everything with a written sheet so now I'm better at using our equipment than my husband! How empowering! What good is all this fancy stuff if you can't use it? <BR><BR>I read the review previous to mine and am not sure about their experience but mine was awesome, I have since referred two co-workers and they have both told me the same thing about their experiences. We will definitely have them back to do our bedroom soon. True professionals... ";
