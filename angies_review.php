$data[$pos]['member_comments'] = "Avoid this circus show at all costs! And if you do go with them, make sure you get everything in writing from these guys!! Not just the prices but the capabilities of the system you have them install as well. For example, if they say you’ll be able to self monitor your alarm from your phone without a monthly charge get it in writing. Or, if they tell you you’ll be able to break up audio zones and listen to different things in different rooms such as TV in your living room and music in another, you better get it in writing. So here’s my \"Honest\" Install experience:<BR><BR>I wouldn’t normally call out people by their names, but since Bobby C. lied right to my face about multiple things I feel it’s appropriate. Alarm:Before dealing with \"Honest\" Install, I got another quote for an alarm system that was free up front for the equipment and install but required a 2 year monitoring contract at $50 a month. Bobby from honest install quoted me $1,199 for a Honeywell Tuxedo \"bundle\" and another $250 for the matching Honeywell thermostat. I told Bobby about the other quote and that I thought $1500 for an alarm was too much considering the other quote was for a free system but required a contract. He then told me the price difference was because the Tuxedo uses my wifi network and I could self monitor the system from my phone and would not have to pay a monthly fee. I told him I’d go ahead and get his $1500 system because without a monitoring fee it would pay for itself in a few years. He agreed. When the installer was all finished, I asked him to show me how to connect to, and control the system from my phone. The installer then told me that was not possible without having a monitoring service. He tells me Honeywell has the system locked so even with wifi I still have to pay a monitoring fee if i want to control it from my phone. Needless to say I was confused and figured it was a mistake since Bobby told me all I needed to self monitor from my phone was wifi. So I then asked him to show me how to control the thermostat from my phone. He tells me the thermostat is linked to the alarm and can only be controlled remotely once I set up the monitoring service for the alarm. So now I’m asking myself, why would anyone pay $1500 for an alarm and thermostat that still requires a monitoring service fee when I could have gone with the first quote that would have saved me $1500 and a Nest thermostat that has a free phone control app? I emailed Bobby and question him about all this. He claims he never told me I could self monitor from my phone without a paying for a monitoring service. He says he told me I could self monitor from the Tuxedo control panel for free but to monitor from my phone requires a monitoring contract for $40 a month. The Tuxedo control panel they installed is located in my entryway next to my front door. Why would anyone want to self monitor an alarm by standing in their entryway looking a panel mounted on the wall? Makes no sense, why even have an alarm then?  Audio:Bobby also quoted me for a complete home entreatment system with in ceiling speakers for my living room and bed/bath room. He told me I could listen to my tv over my in ceiling bed/bath speakers. He also said I could split the audio up and listen to TV in my living room and, at the same time, play music from my phone in my bed/bath. Well, when the installers finished and started demoing the system for me, I asked them to play TV audio in my bed/bath. They said this receiver can’t do that. But wait, Bobby said it could! So after reading the receivers manual, it turns out \"zone 2\" (bed/bath speakers) can only play analog audio, not digital. Seeing that pretty much all audio devices are digital these days, I’m limited in what can be listened to in my bed/bath. I will give credit to the audio/video installers. They were very nice, professional, and did a great job. So I email and ask Bobby about this, he says, zone 2 is a \"basic zone\". Why would I have paid $700+ for in ceiling speakers in my bed/bath and another $700 for a fancy receiver then? Bobby lied again. So now its been a month since my install. My alarm and stereo still do not work as Bobby told me they would and Bobby hasn’t responded to my last couple emails. But wait! I get an email from \"Honest\" Install informing me that Bobby no longer works for them. Clearly its not just me he’s been screwing around….. I email them back and still here nothing. Its been over a month since my install, I’ve paid these clowns $7,500 and my system still doesn’t work as I was told it would.  Maybe now that I’m posting this review John Manouel or someone from \"Honest\" Install will finally contact me.";

They even patched a hole I had from a prior nail I had that was just over where they hung the TV.  They did a great job of cleaning up, leaving my home in the same shape as they found it.  I think they actually left it better, since my TV and new sound system has my wife and I feeling like we are in a movie theater.

They replaced it with one built of pressure treated wood and reinstalled it at no cost.  I really appreciate them taking the time to listen to my concerns about how this was done and responding accordingly.  Below are my original notes on what occured.  I would still use them again, they are professional and do good work.  <BR><BR>First, this review only applies to the outdoor portion of the work that was completed.  I had approximately $3,500 worth of work done total.   All the indoor services were also reviewed and at a high grade.  However, the outdoor cabinet that was constructed is already falling apart.  It has warping due to the weather and one of the doors was blown off from the wind (when the technician said he would return to put in stronger door secures, but never followed up again on it).  <BR>I was originally quoted a weather resistant custom cabinet, however it has only been 8 months and there is warping all over the cabinet.  When I went back to them to get it fixed or rectified, they quoted me another $800 (estimate from them with a supposed 10% discount) on repairing it with pressure treated wood.  However, I was originally quoted that it would be constructed with pressure treated wood.  I don't think I should have to pay for a complete cabinet to be remade when it was not made correctly the first time and the door is now ripped off from the cabinet because the tech never followed up.  My neighbor has the exact type of cabinet that is exposed to the same elements and has had no similar problems.  If they could not make this type of cabinet or if it was not in their experience level then they should not have quoted it to me in the first place.";

He apologized and made appt for next morning. Upon explaining AGAIN that we were not living there and going out just to meet him, could he please make it closer to 9:30. John said no problem and that he had no appts before me so it should not be an issue. Well guess what. Same thing. Call at 10:20 and he answers saying he was just about to call. Hmmmm ..

We just needed the basic set up in our living room.  After doing some research on Angie's list I was able to find Honest Install.  All their reviews showed that this organization went well beyond he norm to take care of their clients.  
It was no surprise from the initial call and consultation we were with the right company.  After sending in come pictures on the potential location of our TV Brion walked me through the process.  He could have taken guided me to a more expensive alternative but instead he said we can manage this set up in an affordable manner.  <BR>
A few days later Michael and David showed up for the installation.  From the beginning they were very professional and jumped to the task in a quick manner.  Even though our installation was a \" normal or simple\" installation they took the time to explain what they were doing throughout the process.  They both also went the extra step to clean up during the installation and assisted with wire management that made our system look sleek and professional.  When we get our other rooms set up I will request that both of these gentlemen come back.<BR>
We are very pleased with the service and glad that Honest Install was able to help us.  It took us a long time to find them but we plan us Honest Install for all our home automation.";

He provided a quote a few days later via email.  I thought the quote a high but noticed a third of the cost was setting up the 5.1 speakers so I decided to do that myself before the install date in order to save several hundred dollars.<BR><BR>

Honest Install did a good job.   The two technicians showed up a little after 9 AM and began to setup the equipment after a short review of expectations from me.  The guys were professional and accommodating.  I even called an audible during the install and asked the installers to run an Ethernet cable from my office where the Verizon router was located to my entertainment center and they were able to add that to the job with little effort.   When they left around a 1 PM everything was setup correctly and working.  The installers were friendly and methodical and took their time to make sure it was done correctly.<BR><BR>

The only caveat to the install that I was less happy with is that I was still hit with nearly $200 for connecting the speaker for which I had already pre run the wiring as well as hung the speakers.  All they needed to do was connect it. Even then that fee was a reduction in the nearly original $300 to install them.  One technician did spend an inordinate amount of time connecting the speakers which should not have required much effort at all.  I felt the $200 fee was too high should have been reduced much further given the work required.<BR><BR>

Mounting the television over the fireplace was the largest part of the install from my perspective and was the primary motivation for hiring them.  Much of the other work can be done yourself if you have the time and I just felt the $930 (in four hours) cost to perform all these services was too high.

Honest Install totally blew me away with their expertise, skill, and professionalism.
</p>
<p>
John, the Sales Manager, and Ashley were extremely helpful, courteous, and responsive in assisting me with my inquiry.  They readily provided a competitive price quote on the exact model TV I requested, and John was especially efficient and thorough in quickly identifying the key details of the installation and in determining what services and hardware would be required.  John provided a very accurate, detailed, and comprehensive price quote.
</p>
<p>
Dave and Brandon showed up right on time, and even called me before arrival to let me know they were en route.  They got right to work, and their high level of expertise was immediately clear.  They first removed the old TV, and then installed the new one exactly to my specifications.  On their own initiative, they even found a way to reuse the old mount, which saved me hundreds of dollars.  The result is a beautiful, masterfully executed installation that exceeded my expectations in every way.
</p>
<p>
Dave and Brandon were very thorough in cleaning up, removing all traces of their work as well as all boxes and other material.  They also took the time to show me how to work all the features of the new TV and answered every one of my questions.  They even gave me a receipt for the donated value of the old TV which I can use for my taxes.  And they were so professional throughout the entire service visit.
</p>
<p>
I've had several TVs installed before, by a number of different companies.  I have high standards, and I'm not easily satisfied.  But I was beyond impressed with Honest Install.  This is the best TV installation experience I've ever had, by far.  I will never consider using anyone else, ever again.

    At the beginning everything seemed to be going well. I called on Wednesday they set up an appointment for the following Friday. Although they arrived about an hour late, I was okay with that.  We went through the house looking at everything (even opening outlets), they went into the attic, and they left with a full list of everything that I needed. I asked that the different requests be broken down, as I wanted the option of buying my own equipment and/or staggering the work.  When they left, I felt very good about the experience and was looking forward to working with them.
    </p>
    <p>
    By the next Wednesday afternoon, I still did not have a quote.  I called and was told \"We're so sorry, we are abnormally busy. But I'll get your quote out tonight.\"  I said fine...and waited.  Again.... nothing arrived.  Finally, on Saturday afternoon, 8 days later after the onsite call and 3 days after I called to check on it, a quote showed up. 
    </p>
    <p>
    Sadly, I could quickly tell it was hurriedly pasted from their standard pricing menu, as everything was quoted exactly as it is posted on their website (same price ranges, same disclaimer abut services that weren't necessary in our case, etc.).  I honestly don't have any idea why they took the time to come to my home, nor why they bothered to email a quote -- they might as well have just told me to go to http://www.honestinstall.com/pricing-and-services.php and figure it out myself.
    </p>
    <p>
    In addition, the quote entirely overlooked many very specific and critical requests.  For example: the wireless reception in our home theatre is spotty at best, so we wanted to activate the pre-wired ethernet in that room so movies can stream without interruption.  During the visit, the representative took the time to open a wall plate to confirm there was already a Cat5 wire in that particular box -- which means there was no need to drop cables, no coring, no drywall work, etc.   But when the quote arrived, it left out that room entirely!   There was also no mention about wiring the second bedroom upstairs, nor the downstairs office (which is where the Uverse modem is located so without that room there is nothing to \"connect.\"), nor the entertainment center downstairs, etc. 
BUT they did manage to get in all the equipment quotes.  Multiple  big screen TV options, wall mounts, AV receivers, speakers, the actual ethernet switch... Basically everything that I specifically said was optional.
    </p>
    <p>
    To be honest, I was perfectly willing to buy the equipment from them -- but not without a decent quote on the necessary wiring work. 
To be fair. I did give them the opportunity to update the quote before posting this review because I understand that things do happen, and other reviews for this firm are quite good.   So I wrote back to explain that I was disappointed, that the quote was incomplete, and I provided precise details on what was still missing.  They wrote back to apologize for being busy yet again, and admitted the first quote was indeed incomplete, but STILL didn't bother to actually update it.   I suppose they are so \"abnormally busy\" that they've already written me off as a potential customer.
    </p>
    <p>
    So -- I'm still on the hunt for someone who would like to secure a long-term, potentially quite profitable AV customer. All I need to start that relationship is a decent quote to activate the ethernet in 6 rooms of my pre-wired house.

<p>
Frankly I'm a bit of a cheapskate so initially I thought perhaps the price initially was a little high.  But because they seemed so committed to customer service I decided to go ahead.  Cody came out first to size things up.  He gave me a quote that they honored.  Initially I was going to also buy a TV from them.  However I found a sale and Cody was kind enough to look at a couple of pictures/specs I sent to his phone and advise me as to which was the best deal.  
</p>
<p>
The installation team showed up on time, they were courteous, professional and very competent.  They set me up with a universal remote and were incredibly patient in programming it exactly they way I asked.  I know I was being a bit particular but they never made me feel as though I was putting them out.
</p>
<p>
I also added Slingbox, remote headphones, etc. and they made it all work seamlessly together.  Bottom line is that they did a wonderful job and got me set up with a system in my house that I could really enjoy.  Had I known it would be this great of an experience I wouldn't have thought twice about the cost.  
</p>
<p>
Now comes the good part.  Afterwards I had a couple of issues/problems.  There was no problem with their service or components.  The issues were all the result of \"operator error.\"  I am a techno-moron.  However, Cody spoke with me on the phone several times walking me through and helping me get things back on track.
</p>
<p>
I still couldn't get my computer to play on my television via an hdmi cable.  When he couldn't talk me through it on the phone he insisted on coming to my house at no additional charge and troubleshooting the problem.  While he was here he figured out the problem was a defective hdmi cable.  The cable was purchased on-line and not from Honest Install.  Then when I mentioned my Sling-box was not working the way I had hoped he looked at it and realized that I needed a couple of additional cables to make it work at its best.   He drove to a nearby store, bought the cables and came back and set it up for me.
</p>
<p>
I have been in sales myself for many years.  I recognize and appreciate good customer service.  Honest Install and Cody in particular have gone ridiculously beyond what any reasonable person could possibly expect from a company/individual.  If you need the type of service they provide, call them - you will not be disappointed.  They have my permission to give my phone number to any one that would like a reference.  These guys are the awesome - thank you Cody!

<p>            
  After seeing such great reviews, I contacted Honest Install to have a projector replaced in my home theater. That's really all I wanted, but the salesman thought it would be a good idea to come out and take a look at my setup beforehand, so I scheduled an appointment.  Made arrangements to be home for the appointment, but he failed to show up.  When I was able to reach him the following day, he explained that there had been some error on the calendar . . . . I reschedule, and he comes out. He scheduled me for Friday, August 30, 2013 between 9-12 to install the projector. Salesman made sure I understood that work would begin between 9-12. No problem. No show, again. Started trying to call the business, and I could only get Cody's voicemail. That's all I ever get when i call, by the way.  After about 20-30 minutes, my original salesman calls me back. \"Oh, I thought it was for tomorrow.  Let me check. It's on my phone. I'll call you back.\"  Another 20-30 minutes later goes by, and he calls me back with some nonsense about sending me an email, and I was supposed to confirm. No, we had a firm appointment, time and everything. Very disappointed.          
</p>
<p>
UPDATE: I have reviewed the owner's response, and he simply doesn't know what happened. There was never any understanding that I needed to confirm anything. It was a firm appointment with an arrival time. The salesman explicitly stated when he was at my house that I didn't need to put down a deposit because the work to be done wasn't going to be more than about $150.  All this other stuff is just a bunch of excuses that the salesman came up with when he dropped the ball.  Remember, this was the SECOND time he had failed to show up for an appointment.

I learned real fast just how mechanically challenged I am.  I bought what I thought was a decent stud finder ($20), had my drill out with the proper bit, my level, all the screws and bolts laid out, and was ready to go.  Marked the center of my wall, had my son help me level the bracket, marked the drill spots in the centers of what I "thought" were proper studs, according to the stud finder.  Drilled my first hole and guess what?  There was no stud there.  Drilled through the sheetrock into thin air.  I was mortified.<br>Packed it all up and called these guys.  John let me know straight away that they had the solution.  He scheduled the appointment for me (was about 3 days out), walked me through the steps, including patching up the hole I made in the wall, and made sure we agreed on the charges and that I knew what I was being charged for.  He, to my delight, also gave me $25.00 discount for finding them on AL.  Chandler and Jerry showed up right on time (called me 30 minutes in advance of arriving).  They quickly surveyed the situation and had my tv mounted and ready to go in an hour or less.  They were very nice, very professional.  I will call them again in a heartbeat rather than attempt this again on my own.';

Everything went smoothly with the installation - from the time that Chris and John came around to inspect what was required and presented their estimation for the job, to the time that Drew, Dave, Chandler and Mike completed the installation.  I was impressed with their professionalism, and the fact that they explained what they were doing each step of the way.<br>What I also liked was that upon the initial meeting, Chris/John did not try to sell anything to me, and were prepared to work with my exiting audio/stereo/TV equipment. It was only after I asked several questions on available options, that they suggested wall mounting the TV / Cable Box/ DVD player, adding a sound bar (even then they gave me several options - not just going to high end Bose Cinemate system which I eventually picked) so as to avoid running wiring under carpets etc.<br>On a side note, I chose to add the ROKU 3   internet streaming box, which is causing some issues since it keeps dropping wireless internet connectivity, however that is probably related to the product itself and not the installation. (I discussed this with John shortly after the installation, and he is willing to send out a tech to look at the issue..again, this speaks to the great customer service these guys provide!)
I am going to call Honest Install again later this year to complete a couple of projects in the master and guest bedrooms and I would highly recommend these guys to my  friends and family.......call them, you won\'t regret it!';

Dru and Chandler were the installers and did a great job of running cables and even split the sub inputs to make it stereo. I\'ve been watching a few movies since and am happy with the setup.';

Because I was having the TV installed (and didn\'t trust any of the big boxes to do it) for my parents at their house and I couldn\'t be there to do it, I went on here to find someone that could be trusted.  On Sunday, 12/2/12, someone else called me to inform me that there was a conflict with this time and that they would need to change their install time to begin between 12:30 and 1pm.  At this point, we agreed.  The installers didn\'t arrive until 1:45.  My expectations were probably unreasonable when I thought that they would arrive on-time after rescheduling a prior appointment, but I know that at least they could have called and said they were going to be 45 minutes late.  They did not.  The reason for the agitation stems from my father having a doctor\'s appointment that he had to be at in the afternoon and that the 45 minutes is what cost him his ability to make it.  We tried to be flexible.  No one called to apologize until after I called and left a complaint voice mail.  When I received the call, no compensation was offered for the time and appointment lost.  <br>The work performed was very good and up to standard.  The timeliness and professionalism were, in my opinion, not..';
/* //From Here is the Company Response
<b>Company Response: <br>
.
<br>
<br>
.
We want to sincerely apologize to the Member and his Father:
<br>BACKGROUND
<br>
<br>We had called the day before the installation date to re-position the arrival window for 12-1pm instead of earlier in the morning. We always try and give a one hour arrival and not a super large window
like the cable companies do so customers are not held hostage at home waiting for us, at least that is the idea behind the policy. <br>
<br>
We had the wife of one of our technicians go into labor and so he had to take Monday and the following days off so we knew we were going to be short-staffed and had to regroup, thus the reason for the change in arrival time, which the Member did agreed to.
We had the wife of one of our technicians go into labor and so he had to take Monday and the following days off so we knew we were going to be short-staffed and had to regroup, thus the reason for the change in arrival time, which the Member did agreed to.
<br>
<br>
Sometimes though trying to hit tight arrival times, as to not inconvenience our customers, does not allow for unforeseen traffic or appointment overflow. 
<br>
<br>
The technician crew did experience a little overage time with the installation previous which put us about 45min late to the Member's Father's home. 
<br>
<br>
We were not aware of the appointments that the Member's Father had that day nor of any time constraints or deadlines for the work to be completed so he could leave for his appointment.
<br>
<br>
<br>
AFTER INSTALL
<br>
<br>
When the Member called and left a voicemail explaining, our Installation Manager immediately called the Member to express our deepest apologies.
<br>
<br>
We already had planned to mail in some sort of compensation but it was just not communicated at the time of the phone call.
<br><br>
Anytime we mail gifts or referral checks it is usually done in a batch at the end of a month or quarter but in this case we have already mailed the Members gift.
<br><br><br>
IN SUMMARY
<br><br>
Regardless of the issues that delayed our technician-team the day of, we acknowledge it did cause a major inconvenience for the Member and we do truly apologize for the hassle incurred.
<br><br>
We definitely should have done a better job of communicating with the Member.
<br><br>
It is a rarity but it really stresses us to hear that we missed the mark for any of our clients no matter if it is from a technical standpoint or customer service wise.
<br><br>
We will continue on our perpetual effort to improve our service and hope the Member and his father will enjoy their new Fireplace TV.
<br><br><br>

Instead of honoring the work as a warranty issue Chris was righteously indignant that it was my fault (can\'t see how it could be since it had to do with install of a custom shelf we discussed and clearly the job unfinished - equipment on night tables until shelf arrived), and claimed my complaint was "a preference issue not a warranty issue." It was only after I reminded him I was an Angie\'s list customer he offered to have his people re-inspect. Ultimately I no longer trusted the man and had to go with another company to redo/finish the work at a cost of an additional $600. Overall not satisfied. There is nothing worse than a contractor who does work out of obligation to prevent bad press-not because they stand behind the workmanship. This results in poor workmanship, a poor customer experience, and certainly is not deserving of additional business. That\'s my take-as the CUSTOMER (something Chris seemed to forget). Overall I think my above review is generous. The F review re professionalism is directed at the owner for the above reasons.<br><br><b>In response to the company </b>I would just say that it is INACCURATE and makes baseless allegations about my perceived intent to have work done for free after paying several thousand for the job. In fact, I had to pay another company $600 to correct "Honest\'s" mistakes-and I was happy to do it not to have Honest come back in my home. Just beware. I appreciate the well wishes from the company, but the accusation that I was angling for free work after Honest damaged my home and performed a substandard job is offensive and warrants a response. I\'ll leave it at that rather than crawl further into a sandbox with an owner who is simply trying to create a record that mitigates a well deserved poor rating. I wish the company the best in its future endeavors and hope they strive to deliver a better product for the sake of their consumers in the future. ';

<b>Company Response: 
<br>.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>.
<br>
<br>
<br>Company Response to the member Report:
<br>
<br>
<br>BACKGROUND
<br>
The member engaged us after he had called several companies and they or he refused to agree on the timeline and pricing that he insisted upon. We agreed to meet the member at his new home not once (prior to install) but twice so we could meet his contractors. This was very early one morning and outside of our normal operating hours but we obliged at his insistence.
<br><br>
At the time of the consultation we had initially spoke about and quoted him on four separate room/areas: the Living Room, Master Bedroom, Patio & Bonus Room. The home was under renovation and a lot of items/options/possibilities were thrown around. I do remember him briefly mentioning his possible plans to add some shelving in the cove area where the components were to go but again we bounced around a dozen or so ideas.
<br><br>
I then completed the quotation for all areas, the member decided to move forward but reduced the overall scope and had us focus on the Patio and the Living Room only. He agreed to the estimate which was itemized and had the length of all cabling clearly listed. If the cord lengths were not up to future requirements/possible renovation of the cabinetry I would assume he would have expressed concern at that point. The TV was located approx 5-7ft to the right of the area where the equipment was to be located and we provided 15ft cabling. It is highly unusual to provide anything longer based upon an installation of this type.
<br>
<br><br>
AFTER INSTALLATION
<br><br>
We were called back several times after the entire installation was done by the member for minor cosmetic issues, much of which was hidden behind all the equipment and some would argue were not warranty issues at all, rather personal preference, but we were happy to do it and accommodated him. After the third visit back (and a few weeks later) we got an email that according to the member the cords were not long enough for his future planned cabinet re-do. We recommended extending them but the member did not like the idea of extending them and possibly wanted all new cabling ran at which point was a complete do-over from an installation standpoint. We still scheduled the appointment and prepared for the changes but prior to appointment date I expressed my concern and wanted to be upfront and let him know that we were happy to do the work but that it would not be covered by his warranty as nothing was defective or malfunctioning.
<br><br>
See since the very beginning the member had been struggling with the decision whether or not to use special plates on the wall. These plates are placed where the equipment goes and you then connect short jumper cords from the wall plate to the equipment similar to what you might find in an office or commercial setting. We believed he had then decided that this is what he wanted after all and was using the cords being too short as a way to get this work done for free.
<br><br>
At this point his language in his email back to us had turned angry and threats of negative reviews were made by the member, so against our better judgment we felt we had no choice but to try and accommodate him for another, fourth visit. Our service manger, who was in on the email conversation, had gone personally to our cable supplier and hand picked out all of the various plates he would need which the member insisted should only cost us about $25 at the local Home Depot, not true. The total WHOLESALE cost was more than $100, we made the offer to the member to just pay for our cost on the plates and we would eat the labor charge in order to make him happy and to close out the job. This would kill two birds: heâ€™d get his plates after all and weâ€™d solve the alleged cable length issue. We even invited him to our office to inspect the plates prior to installation to make sure they were going to be up to his liking (thus far the member had been extremely picky about the smallest of details and we wanted to be sure he approved). After the invitation was made we did not hear back from the memberâ€¦
<br>
<br><br>
IN SUMMARY
<br><br>
We made numerous attempts to accommodate the member's demands and even fix the mistakes made by his paint contractor (the cables had been painted over by mistake and had to be replaced) in addition we were a bit surprised by the change in tone by the member because up to that point we were very accommodating, so much so the member asked us to come back for another installation in the Bonus Room and to replace some defective speakers on the Patio left by the previous owner.
<br><br>
Our service manager/product purchaser and our technician team worked hard to accommodate his requests and given the above I would like to extend them the following from me as a proud owner:
<br><br>
-Pricing: A
<br>-Professionalism: A
<br>-Patience: A++
<br><br>
In our book the difference between an â€œokayâ€? company and a â€œgreatâ€? company is that a great company will never abandon the customer and will stick with you to try to resolve any matters (even when deemed unreasonable). We never ignored the member, we responded to every phone call and email; we stuck with him the entire time and never refused to perform follow-up/additional work. As a company we shall always continue to strive for this greatness.
<br><br>
We truly wish the members an enjoyable & happy new chapter in their lives in their new home.
<br>
<br><br>
-Chris Manouel
<br>President, Honest Install

They listened, they advised and they performed.
Pricing was very competitive ... lower than the large stores and competitive with the independents.  NOT the most expensive OR the cheapest - but you will get everything you pay for ... competently and professionally done.  And you will NOT be oversold a lot of cables and equipment you never needed.  <br>Chris manages and operates a very \'customer-focused\' business:  NO HARD SELL, NO UP-SELL !   He and each of his installers are very courteous and were always on time - calling to confirm appts and arrival times.  He is a \'hands-on\' owner who ensures things are going well and as expected.<br>The installation was complex - spread over several different days because I was having drywall construction, cabinets and bookshelves installed and painting during this process -  in between initial AV wiring, TV install and final AV equipment relocation into my closet.  Discussed the complexity of timing with Chris who advised when each construction and installation element should be executed.  All went well with NO hitches ! 
The only attribute I wish I had asked about was "cable management" behind the rack of multiple components !It is a massive maze of wiring and cables.<br>I cannot say enough good things about the organization. And I am in no way connected to any of them !  This organization needs to be on everyone\'s short list for anything related to AV projects - small or large. ';

Once we got another HD cable box from Time-Warner Chris returned to install it and install and program the universal remote. So unassuming was Chris and so humble of demeanor that we were surprised to learn later that he actually owns the firm. This was a five-star, first rate experience from beginning to end. Four trips and all of them involved on-time arrival, a clear understanding of what was to be done, and extraordinary neatness in the installations themselves. In the (we hope unlikely) event we need these kinds of services again we\'d call them in a heartbeat. Great work ethic, by a local firm with clear commitment to customer service, no "upsell" shenanigans, and all four who visited arrived in a timely way, were pleasant, congenial, and competent. We simply could not be happier with our experience and regard the cost as fair and reasonable.';

$data[$pos]['member_comments'] = 'The Update: Chris was kind enough to come out on a snowy, sleety, wet Sunday to help us with the operation of the systems. We worked out a couple of glitches and now are very happy with the install. He left us with a written cheat sheet. Thanks, Chris. When I called for the appointment, Chris asked lots of questions about where & how things were to be placed to determine which service we needed. They required a one-half deposit by credit card before setting the appointment. The installers, Peter and Clint, were punctual. They entered the house and got to work like the devil was chasing them, probably due to the Christmas rush. They were here for a mere 2 hours. They tore into boxes to get the components, brought in the tools and ladder and went at it. We provided the mount. It turned out that the blu-ray and cable box would not sit on the mantle because we bought the largest possible TV that would fit the space. The sound bar fit on the mantle and the other pieces are on the hearth nearby. They put in a cable hiding runner to cover the wires that showed. Peter was able to program the components for the most part. He said he had Verizon Fios at home so was familiar with it. However, the sub-woofer would not work and the internet connection would not work. The next day, we found out that a part, the wireless digital transmitter, was missing from the sub-woofer. Although they had taken the boxes with them, I rechecked the soft packaging and didn\'t find that transmitter. I had to call the seller and get a new system sent out & returned the old. Also, we had to go buy an optical digital cable to get the TV to speak through the sound bar. Meanwhile, we still can\'t get the internet connection to work. Peter said he didn\'t know why it wouldn\'t work, and it really wasn\'t his area & we needed to contact Verizon. When we were working on the internet connection, Peter ASKED PERMISSION to go in the other room where the wireless router was located. That\'s a first. We are still bumbling around trying to learn all the features and how to operate the remotes, and still can\'t get the internet connection to work. It looks like education beyond basic operations costs more. :(';
